### AIFCCalc: An Excel spreadsheet for modeling simultaneous assimilation and imperfect fractional crystallization



##### Koshi Nishimura

This program calculates the trace element and isotopic compositions of liquid, suspended crystals, and magma (liquid + suspended crystals) during simultaneous assimilation and imperfect fractional crystallization (AIFC). The calculations are based on the model of Nishimura (2012).
